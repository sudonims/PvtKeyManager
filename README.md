<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This is a simple Private Key Manager. Inspired from the <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin">Bitcoin core</a> technology for wallet management, it doesn't need internet connection, rather this encrypts your entered data to a file which can be stored locally. The file is encrypted with cryptographically secured AES algorithm whose private keys are generated with <a href="https://github.com/sudonims/PR-Pass">PR-Pass</a>. 

### Built With

- Flutter
- Dart
- Go
- Android Studio

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

### Installation
Currently this project supports Linux, Android and Windows Operating Systems. MacOS support will be added soon

You can use it as you would any normal package, just open it and you are good to go

#### Note
1. Linux users might need to make the file executable in order to make it run
	```bash
	chmod +x <filename>
	```
2. Windows users need to extract the .7z file and run exe file directly. Note that rest files are needed from archive in order for the exe to work.
